# Simple dotfiles setup

At the moment this only really contains configs for `tmux` and `vim/neovim`

## Prerequisites

You will want to install the following manually as we are not at the point of
automatic install:

* Git
* Homebrew
* Neovim
* Tmux

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/keithschulze/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```
